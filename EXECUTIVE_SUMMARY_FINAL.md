## 💰 Business Model (Simplified)

### The Math

```
REVENUE STREAMS (Year 1)
├─ Owner subscriptions (100 @ ₹1,000)    = ₹1L/month
├─ E-invoice transactions (50K @ ₹5)    = ₹2.5L/month
└─ Payment processing (100K @ ₹50 × 2%) = ₹1L/month
                                    TOTAL = ₹4.5L/month
                                    ANNUAL = ₹54L

FREE CUSTOMER BASE: 50,000 (viral)
PAID OWNERS: 100 → 200 by end of year
```

### Why Freemium Works

```
Traditional Software:
  Charge everyone → Growth limited by sales effort
  
Freemium Network:
  Free for customers → Viral adoption → Network grows
  Network value → Owners want to use it → They pay
  More customers → More revenue from transactions
  
Result: 4.5x revenue with LESS sales effort!
```
