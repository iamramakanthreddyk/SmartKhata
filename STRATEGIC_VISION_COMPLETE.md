Result: Two-sided platform (Khatabook + Tally combined)
         + Network effects + Viral growth
```

## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

### The Three Layers

**Layer 1: Owners (WHO PAY)**
```
Free Tier      ₹0      15 invoices/month
DIAMOND        ₹499    50 invoices + templates
PLATINUM       ₹1,999  200 invoices + GST + analytics
ENTERPRISE     ₹5,999  Unlimited + white-label
```

**Layer 2: Customers (FREE TIER)**
```
View invoices from all businesses

```

## 💰 Revenue Model (Updated)

### Year 1 Breakdown

```
OWNER SUBSCRIPTIONS
  100 owners @ ₹1,000/month average
  = ₹1L/month

E-INVOICE PROCESSING
  50,000 invoices/month × ₹5 (after limit)
  = ₹2.5L/month

PAYMENT PROCESSING
  100,000 customer payments × ₹50 × 2%
  = ₹1L/month

TOTAL MONTHLY: ₹4.5L
ANNUAL: ₹54L

FREE CUSTOMER BASE: 50,000 (future monetization)
```

### Why 4.5x Multiplier?

```
Without Freemium:
  • Only owners use platform
  • 100 owners @ ₹1,000 = ₹1L/month
  • Limited engagement

With Freemium:
  • 50,000 customers use platform (viral)
  • Each customer transaction = revenue
  • Each payment processed = revenue
  • Customers become viral marketers
  • 4.5x revenue multiplier achieved
```
